# Bachelor-Thesis-
This is my final thesis for my bachelor degree in Astronomy at the University of Padua. In this thesis I have reported the main astrophysical phenomena from which it is possible to infer the Magnetic Field of the Milky Way, focusing on the possible explanation for itâ€™s apparent inversion. The thesis is written in italian.
